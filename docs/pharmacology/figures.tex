\caption{BMD Architecture Analysis demonstrating comprehensive frame selection and computational metabolism. Top row shows frame repository distribution (1,000 total frames across 10 categories), frame selection distribution across cognitive categories (social 16.4\%, perceptual 13.6\%, spatial 13.4\%, emotional 10.0\%, aesthetic 9.6\%, ethical 8.4\%, existential 7.6\%, cognitive 7.4\%, temporal 6.6\%, causal 7.0\%), and dynamic architecture growth (1.01Ã— growth factor with 2 expansions).

% Figure 2: Molecular Recognition Distribution - Place after molecular recognition section
% Rationale: Validates the recognition specificity equations and threshold concepts from Section 1.2
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/molecular_recognition.png}
\caption{Distribution of Molecular Identification Confidence in BMD systems. The bimodal distribution demonstrates clear separation between high-confidence molecular recognition (>0.9) and low-confidence background noise (<0.7). The membrane resolution threshold at 0.7 (red dashed line) effectively discriminates between specific and non-specific molecular interactions, validating the theoretical framework for BMD selective recognition capabilities presented in Section 1.2. This empirical evidence supports the recognition specificity equation $\text{Recognition Specificity} = \frac{K_{\text{target}}}{K_{\text{target}} + \sum_{i} K_{\text{off-target},i}}$.}
