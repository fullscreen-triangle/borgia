## Project Vision

**Borgia** is a  cheminformatics confirmation engine that serves as the molecular evidence workhorse for the larger biological intelligence ecosystem (Hegel, Lavoisier, Gospel, Bene Gesserit, etc.). Unlike mainstream cheminformatics that applies universal methods to millions of molecules, Borgia performs **purpose-driven, evidence-constrained, probabilistic molecular analysis** on small sets of highly relevant molecules.



### The Problem with Mainstream Cheminformatics

**Universal Methods = Universal Failures**
- One-size-fits-all algorithms designed for speed over precision
- Deterministic representations that ignore molecular uncertainty
- Blind computation without considering why analysis is needed
- Methods that work "generally" but fail in specific critical cases

### Borgia's Solution: Evidence-Driven Probabilistic Cheminformatics

1. **Small Search Space**: Analyze 3-10 molecules suggested by upstream evidence, not millions
2. **Enhanced Representations**: Pack maximum fuzzy information into molecular descriptors
3. **Probabilistic Methods**: All comparisons return probability distributions, not binary scores
4. **Purpose-Driven**: Only compute what upstream systems actually need

## Core Architecture

### Evidence Propagation Network
```
Upstream Systems (Hegel, Lavoisier, Gospel) 
    ↓ (Requests specific molecular evidence)
Borgia Cheminformatics Engine
    ↓ (Returns probabilistic molecular evidence)
Upstream Systems (Update belief networks)
    ↓ (May request additional evidence based on new confidence)
Borgia (Adaptive learning from feedback)
```

### System Components

#### 1. **Probabilistic Molecular Representations**
Enhanced chemical descriptors that encode uncertainty and fuzzy molecular properties:

- **Fuzzy Aromaticity**: Probabilistic aromatic character, electron delocalization scores
- **Fuzzy Ring Systems**: Ring strain distributions, puckering probabilities, flexibility membership
- **Fuzzy Functional Groups**: Hydrogen bonding capacity, reactivity potential distributions
- **Fuzzy Stereochemistry**: Chiral center confidence, conformational freedom modeling
- **Quantum-Enhanced Features**: Electronic property distributions, interaction potentials

#### 2. **Evidence-Driven Request Processing**
```rust
pub struct BorgiaRequest {
    requesting_system: UpstreamSystem,      // Which system needs evidence
    molecular_candidates: Vec<Molecule>,    // Small set (3-10 molecules)
    evidence_needed: EvidenceType,          // Specific type of evidence required
    confidence_threshold: f64,              // Upstream confidence level
    objective_function: ObjectiveFunction,  // Tangible purpose for computation
    context: EvidenceContext,               // Why these specific molecules
}
```

#### 3. **Probabilistic Analysis Engines**

**Probabilistic Morgan Algorithm**
- Fuzzy invariant calculations with uncertainty propagation
- Probabilistic hashing functions for molecular fingerprints
- Graph isomorphism with probabilistic variables

**Enhanced Molecular Fingerprints**
- 50,000+ probabilistic features (vs. traditional 1024-4096)
- Context-adaptive feature weighting based on evidence type
- Topological, pharmacophoric, quantum, conformational, and interaction features

**Fuzzy Logic Molecular Comparisons**
- Maximum Common Substructure with fuzzy matching
- Linguistic variables for molecular similarity (very_low, low, medium, high, very_high)
- Hybrid fuzzy-logical programming for complex molecular reasoning

#### 4. **Adaptive Learning System**
- Representation evolution based on upstream feedback
- Context-aware feature enhancement
- Computational budget optimization based on evidence importance
